Some boards may not react correctly when a non-USB power supply is applied.

This was found to be resolved by a firmware update that is connected with how the USB port is managed.

This was run and resolved the problem on an STM32F407G-DISC1 board:

Power was then applied to the 5v and GND pins that are on the right hand side of the board, the topmost pins on the large connector.

This all worked.
