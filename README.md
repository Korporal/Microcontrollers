# Microcontrollers
A repository for various examples and experiments involving microcontrollers.

This is just a place where examples and experiments are accumulated.

I don't have a fork to my own repo so I always push and sometimes force push to branch korporal_development.

Because that branch can received forced pushes you should never pull from it, only from master.

I'll rely on pull requests to get stuff to master.
